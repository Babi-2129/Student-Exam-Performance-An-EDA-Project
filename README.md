# 🎓 Student Exam Performance: An EDA Project

This project explores a dataset of student exam scores to identify patterns and insights about how various factors — such as gender, parental education, lunch type, and test preparation — impact student performance across Math, Reading, and Writing.

## 📁 Dataset Overview

**File:** `StudentsPerformance.csv`  
**Rows:** 1000  
**Columns:** 8  
**Fields include:**
- `gender`
- `race/ethnicity`
- `parental level of education`
- `lunch`
- `test preparation course`
- `math score`
- `reading score`
- `writing score`

---

## 🧠 Objectives

- Perform end-to-end **Exploratory Data Analysis** using Python
- Uncover hidden insights through **visual storytelling**
- Evaluate how different demographic and educational factors influence exam performance
- Create a **Power BI dashboard** to complement and present insights interactively

## 📊 Key Insights

- 🧠 Students with **test preparation** scored significantly higher in reading and writing.
- 👨‍🎓 Those whose parents had a master's degree performed better in all subjects.
- 🍽️ Students with standard lunch consistently scored better than those with free/reduced lunch.
- 👦👧 Males scored better in Math, while females performed better in Reading and Writing.
- 📈 All three scores showed strong positive correlation, especially between Reading and Writing.
